## Higher-Order Function

A higher-order function (HOF) is:

-   A function which takes a function as an argument
-   Or a function which returns a function

**Motivation:**

-   Reduce code duplication
-   Encourage the single-responsibility principle

Function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function)

## Currying and closure

These two related concepts in Typescript:

-   Closure provides a way of binding a context to a function

-   Currying converts a function that takes multiple arguments into a
    function that takes them one at a time.

-   Example: `const f = x => y => x + y;`

**Motivation:**

-   Make it possible to have function with a single parameter that can be
    used for `.map` or `.filter` while some specific context has been
    provided before hand

-   Make it easier to use Point-Free Style

## Purity

A function is pure if the return value is only determined by its parameters

**Motivation:**

-   Make it possible to predict the output based on the input
-   Easier to test

## Side effects

A function has side effects if the output cannot be predicted just by looking
at its input parameters

**Motivation:**

-   Side effects is not desirable from a testing perspective but likely
    necessary in a real world environment

-   Identify side effects to isolate them in a limited number of functions

effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_\(computer_science\))

## Point-Free Style

Point-Free Style allows to chain functions in a very linear way

**Motivation:**

-   Avoid the creation of intermediate variables
-   In best cases increases the readability
